### Hi, I'm Daniil, I'm currently studying at FEFU in the 2nd year of applied mathematics and informatics.


### I can use:


- C/C++ (This is where I wrote the algorithms)
- Python (Here I wrote a simple program and a game P.S. It's not saved â˜¹)
- Swift (This is where I wrote an IOS app for a term paper)
- PostgreSQL
